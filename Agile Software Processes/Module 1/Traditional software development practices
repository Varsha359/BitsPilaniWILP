# Traditional Software Development Practices

Traditional software development practices refer to structured, sequential approaches like the **Waterfall Model**. Below are the key characteristics of these practices:

## Phases in Sequence
1. **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting all project requirements upfront.
2. **Design**: Creating a detailed design plan.
3. **Implementation/Development**: Writing and assembling the code.
4. **Testing**: Testing the entire software product after development.
5. **Deployment & Maintenance**: Delivering the final product and supporting it post-delivery.

## Key Features
- **Upfront Planning**: Meticulous planning at the start of the project with exhaustive documentation.
- **No Overlapping Phases**: Each phase is completed before moving to the next, with no iteration.
- **Fixed Scope**: Requirements are generally fixed early, with little room for changes.
- **Manufacturing Origin**: Inspired by manufacturing practices, emphasizing process-driven structures.
- **Output Dependency**: Output from one phase becomes the input for the next.

## Limitations
- Errors in earlier phases may propagate to later ones, increasing costs and delays.
- Limited customer involvement during development, restricting feedback opportunities.
- Challenges in adapting to evolving requirements or unforeseen changes.

Traditional methods work well for projects with **clearly defined requirements** and **minimal changes**, but their **rigidity** makes them unsuitable for projects requiring adaptability or frequent updates.
